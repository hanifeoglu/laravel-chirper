# ðŸŒŸ Build Chirper with Inertia

## ðŸš€ Introduction
This project is part of the Laravel Bootcamp! In this guide, we will create a modern Laravel application from scratch. We're diving into the creation of a microblogging platform known as "Chirper," exploring the various facets of the Laravel framework.

### Choose Your Own Adventure: JavaScript, Inertia, PHP, & Tailwind

Laravel grants incredible flexibility, allowing the construction of your front-end with various technologies tailored to your needs. This tutorial offers several exciting pathways.

#### JavaScript & Inertia

If JavaScript is your choice, we've got you covered! We provide code samples for both Vue and React. We're integrating Inertia to tie everything together and employing Tailwind CSS for that sleek visual appeal!

If you're pondering over options, we recommend Vue for its user-friendly nature and robust features. And remember, once you've navigated through the Bootcamp, you can revisit to experience the alternate stack!

Ready for the thrill? Select your stack and embark on this coding voyage!
